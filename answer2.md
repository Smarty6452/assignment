To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can implement a database constraint such as a foreign key constraint. This can be done by adding a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table that references the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This will ensure that any value inserted into the "category_id" column in the "Product" table must exist in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table.
